##Notes from Grant Meeting 2016-09-13

###Aim 1
1. How do we identify correct areas?
2. How do we deal with stroma vs gland?
3. How do we quantify robust probability distributions for our descriptors?
* Example: PCA find principle components that explain ~90% variation, we are
trying to find descriptors that explain most of variation.

####Experimental Design
1. ROI Selection(focus on small ROI, scanning window)
2. Some ROIs with persistence diagrams with landscapes, show 
where they came from on the slide, map the visualization from the diagrams back
to the slide.
3. Create slide of:
* Multidimensional scaling
* Bottleneck Heatmap
* Dendrogram

####Thoughts
1. Can we look at biopsies? Is there any valuable information there? 
###Aim 2
1. (John need to weigh in)
